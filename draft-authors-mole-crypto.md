--- abstract

This document specifies the cryptographic construction used to produce and
consume MoLE Endorsements. An Endorsement is an anonymous token that an Anchor
issues to a Client, and that the Client later redeems at a Moderator without
the Anchor being able to link the redemption to the issuance.

This document defines the endorsement issuance protocol, built from a
pairing-free partially blind signature scheme, together with the group,
encoding, and context-binding rules that both the Anchor and the Client follow.

# Introduction

MoLE Endorsements have a number of constraints imposed by the architecture
{{ARCH}}. They must be unlinkable by the Anchor that issued them, they must be
publicly verifiable, and a redemption must hide which Anchor issued the
Endorsement among the set of Anchors a Moderator accepts. Existing systems do
not meet all of these needs. This document defines such a system, the
Issuer-Hiding Anonymous Token (IHAT), which is endorsement type `0x0002` in
{{PROTOCOLS}}.

The construction is a pairing-free partially blind signature {{TESSZHU}}. An
Anchor holds a signing key and issues, in three moves, a signature on a
Client-chosen message that the Anchor never sees. Each Endorsement is also bound
at issuance time to two contexts. These may be used to limit the validity scope
of each Endorsement, i.e., when and for whom it may later be used.

* The issuance context `ctx_iss` is agreed out of band among the Client, the
  Anchors, and the Moderator. `ctx_iss` can encode, for instance, the time
  period in which the Endorsement is issued, allowing us to capture Endorsement
  expiry.
* The redemption context `ctx_red` is selected according to the deployment or
  application profile. For example, a profile may fix it to a domain-separated
  encoding of the target Moderator's long-term identity. This may prevent
  Endorsement reuse across Moderators without requiring synchronized state
  between them. The Client has to know `ctx_red` before issuance, but need not
  contact the Moderator before contacting the Anchor.

## Scope

This document is a work in progress. This revision specifies:

* the prime-order group interface and encodings ({{preliminaries}});
* the protocol context, scalar derivation, Anchor key generation, and context
  binding ({{scheme}});
* the endorsement issuance protocol, that is, the four algorithms `Commit`,
  `Challenge`, `Respond`, and `Finalize`, along with the wire messages they
  exchange, and the endorsement verification equation ({{issuance}});
* endorsement redemption, that is, key rerandomization, the issuer-hiding
  proof over a Moderator's Anchor Set, whose size is logarithmic in that of the
  Anchor Set, and the algorithms `RedeemRequest` and `FinalizeRedeem`
  ({{redemption}});
* two ciphersuites, over P-256 and ristretto255 ({{ciphersuites}}).

The following are **not yet specified** and are marked as such in the text:

* the full security considerations ({{security-considerations}});
* test vectors ({{test-vectors}}).

> **Editorial note.** {{PROTOCOLS}} currently names the grant functions
> `Prepare`, `Sign`, `RequestProof`, `Prove`, and `Finalize`, which assume the
> Client sends the first message. In the construction specified here the Anchor
> sends the first message, so the algorithms are named `Commit`, `Challenge`,
> `Respond`, and `Finalize`. **TODO:** rename these in {{PROTOCOLS}}. The number
> of HTTP exchanges (two) and the endorsement type are unchanged. The redemption
> algorithms are named `RedeemRequest` and `FinalizeRedeem` to align with the
> Moussaka/Longfellow-shaped API. This document already uses `Verify` for
> endorsement verification under a known key ({{verify}}), and {{ARCH}} calls
> the operation a redemption.

> **Editorial note.** This document binds an Endorsement to two contexts, an
> *issuance context* and a *redemption context* ({{context-binding}}).
> Application profiles define their encodings and can fix the redemption
> context to a domain-separated protocol value.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The terms Client, Anchor, Moderator, Endorsement, Credential, and Anchor Set
are used as defined in {{ARCH}}.

Unless otherwise specified, this document encodes protocol messages in TLS
notation ({{Section 3 of TLS13}}). Moreover, all constants are in network byte
order. This document also uses the variable-size vector convention `<V>`
defined in {{HTTP-TRANSPORT}}: the length prefix of such a vector is a
variable-length integer in its minimum-size encoding, so its width depends on
the length of the contents it carries.

The following functions and notation are used throughout this document.

For any byte string `x`, `len(x)` denotes its length in bytes.

For two byte strings `x` and `y`, `x || y` denotes their concatenation.

For a byte string `x`, `x[i..j]` denotes the substring of `x` that begins at
its byte with index `i` and ends just before its byte with index `j`, where
indices start at zero. Its length is `j - i` bytes.

For a list `x`, `x[i]` denotes its element at index `i`, counting from zero,
`x[i..j]` denotes the sublist from index `i` up to but not including index `j`,
and `len(x)` denotes the number of elements it holds.

`I2OSP(x, xLen)` converts a nonnegative integer `x` into a byte string of
length `xLen` in big-endian byte order, as described in {{I2OSP}}.
Before calling `I2OSP`, an algorithm MUST validate that `x < 256^xLen`. In
particular, every value whose length is encoded in two bytes MUST be at most
`2^16 - 1` bytes. A received encoding that violates such a bound is malformed
and causes a `DeserializeError`; invalid local inputs cause a `VerifyError`
unless the algorithm defines `INVALID` as its failure output.

`random(n)` returns `n` uniformly random bytes. Implementations MUST generate
them with a cryptographically secure random number generator. It is the only
source of randomness in this document: every other value that has to be
unpredictable is derived from its output ({{derive-scalar}}).

`Seed(x, k)` denotes the `k`-th seed in a byte string of concatenated seeds,
that is `x[k * Nseed .. (k + 1) * Nseed]`, with `k` counted from zero.
{{ciphersuites}} fixes the seed length `Nseed`.

String values in monospace and quotes, such as `"Challenge"`, are ASCII string
literals and do not include a terminating NUL byte.

All algorithms are laid out in Python-like pseudocode. Each algorithm takes a
set of inputs and parameters and produces a set of outputs. Parameters become
constant values once the ciphersuite is fixed. An algorithm that can fail
raises an error, except where its output explicitly includes `INVALID`; the
errors used in this document are listed in {{errors}}.

# Preliminaries {#preliminaries}

The construction has two dependencies:

Group:
: A prime-order group implementing the interface in {{group}}. {{ciphersuites}}
  gives concrete instances.

Hash:
: A cryptographic hash function whose output length is `Nh` bytes.

## Prime-Order Group {#group}

This document uses an additive, prime-order group, denoted `G`, of order `p`,
as described in {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}}. The types `Element` and `Scalar`
denote elements of the group and of its scalar field respectively. Group
elements are added with `+` and subtracted with `-`; scalar multiplication of
an `Element` `A` by a `Scalar` `r` is written `r * A`. Scalars are added,
subtracted, and multiplied modulo `p`.

The following member functions are used. Except where noted, they are as
defined in {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}}.

Order():
: Outputs the order `p` of the group.

Identity():
: Outputs the identity element of the group.

Generator():
: Outputs the generator element `B` of the group.

ScalarMultGen(r):
: Outputs `r * B`, where `B` is the group generator.

HashToGroup(x):
: Deterministically maps a byte string `x` to an `Element`. Parameterized by a
  domain separation tag (DST); see {{ciphersuites}}.

HashToScalar(x):
: Deterministically maps a byte string `x` to a `Scalar`. Parameterized by a
  DST; see {{ciphersuites}}.

ScalarInverse(s):
: Outputs the multiplicative inverse of the nonzero `Scalar` `s` modulo `p`.

SerializeElement(A):
: Maps an `Element` `A` to a canonical byte string of fixed length `Ne`.

DeserializeElement(buf):
: Attempts to map a byte string `buf` to an `Element`. Raises a
  `DeserializeError` if `buf` is not the canonical encoding of a group element,
  or if it encodes the identity element.

SerializeScalar(s):
: Maps a `Scalar` `s` to a canonical byte string of fixed length `Ns`.

DeserializeScalar(buf):
: Attempts to map a byte string `buf` to a `Scalar`. Raises a
  `DeserializeError` if `buf` does not encode a `Scalar` in the range
  `[0, p-1]`.

This document does not use the `RandomScalar()` member of
{{Section 2.1 of OPRF}}. Every scalar that has to be unpredictable is instead
obtained from `DeriveScalar` ({{derive-scalar}}), which is deterministic in a
random seed. This makes each algorithm reproducible from the seed it is given,
which is what allows the test vectors of {{test-vectors}} to pin the randomness
of an otherwise randomized protocol.

## Errors {#errors}

The following errors are used.

DeserializeError:
: A received byte string is not a valid encoding of the expected type.

VerifyError:
: A received value failed a verification check.

SessionError:
: A message was received for a session that is not in the expected state.

DeriveError:
: A deterministic derivation from a seed failed to produce a usable value. See
  {{derive-scalar}}.

An implementation that raises an error MUST abort the protocol run. Errors are
fatal to the affected session; see {{sessions}}.

# The Endorsement Scheme {#scheme}

Issuance is a three-move protocol between a Client and an Anchor, followed by a
local finalization step at the Client. The Anchor moves first and holds
per-session state between its two moves.

~~~
   Client(pkA, ctx_iss, ctx_red)                Anchor(skA, ctx_iss)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                               state, commitment = Commit(skA, ctx_iss)

                             commitment
                              <--------

   state, challenge = Challenge(pkA, ctx_iss, ctx_red, commitment)

                              challenge
                              -------->

                          response = Respond(skA, state, challenge)

                              response
                              <--------

   endorsement = Finalize(pkA, state, response)
~~~
{: #fig-issuance title="Endorsement issuance overview"}

The Anchor speaks first. This document does not say how the three messages are
carried, nor how a Client that wants an Endorsement reaches an Anchor in the
first place; both are the business of the transport, and a Client will in
general have to signal its intent by some means that carries no protocol data.
For example, over HTTP a Client might ask for issuance in a request with an
empty body, receive the commitment in the response, send the challenge in a
second request, and receive the response in the reply to that. {{wire}}
specifies the encoding of the three messages and their mapping onto the
exchanges of {{PROTOCOLS}}.

Neither context is carried in these messages. Both parties already hold the
issuance context, having agreed on it out of band; the redemption context is
known only to the Client.

The Client's output is an Endorsement that is publicly verifiable under the
Anchor's public key `pkA` ({{verify}}). The Anchor learns neither the nullifier
nor the redemption context bound into it. Under the statistical blindness claim
in {{security-considerations}}, its cryptographic transcript does not link the
Endorsement to the session that produced it.

## Configuration and Protocol Context {#config}

A ciphersuite ({{ciphersuites}}) is identified by an ASCII string
`identifier`. Both parties MUST agree on the ciphersuite before running the
protocol; {{PROTOCOLS}} describes how this agreement is reached.

The *protocol context*, written `ctx_proto`, is the domain separation tag that
this document derives from that identifier:

~~~
def CreateProtocolContext(identifier):
  return "IHATv1-" || identifier
~~~

Throughout the remainder of this document, `ctx_proto` denotes the output of
`CreateProtocolContext` for the ciphersuite in use. It is distinct from the
issuance and redemption contexts of {{context-binding}}: those are inputs to
the protocol, chosen by its participants, whereas `ctx_proto` is fixed by the
ciphersuite.

Every hash this document computes is domain-separated by `ctx_proto`, which it
carries in its DST rather than in its input: `HashToGroup` and `HashToScalar`
are so parameterized ({{ciphersuites}}), and so is `DeriveScalar`
({{derive-scalar}}). Every algorithm below therefore depends on `ctx_proto`,
including those in which it does not appear explicitly, and a value produced
under one ciphersuite does not verify under another. Each algorithm lists
`ctx_proto` among its parameters where it has this dependence.

## Deriving Scalars {#derive-scalar}

Scalars that have to be unpredictable are not sampled directly. They are
derived from a random seed, so that an algorithm is a deterministic function of
the seed it is given:

Input:

~~~
  opaque seed[Nseed]
  PublicInput info
~~~

Output:

~~~
  Scalar s
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
~~~

Errors: `DeriveError`

~~~
def DeriveScalar(seed, info):
  if len(info) > 2^16 - 1:
    raise DeriveError

  derive_input = seed || I2OSP(len(info), 2) || info
  counter = 0
  s = 0

  while s == 0:
    if counter > 255:
      raise DeriveError
    s = G.HashToScalar(derive_input || I2OSP(counter, 1),
                       DST = "DeriveScalar-" || ctx_proto)
    counter = counter + 1

  return s
~~~

The output is never zero, so a caller that needs a nonzero scalar needs no
further check. The loop terminates after one iteration except with probability
approximately `1/p`, and `DeriveError` is raised only if 256 consecutive
iterations yield zero; neither is expected to be observed.

A seed MUST be `Nseed` bytes of `random` output, and MUST NOT be used for more
than one derivation. An algorithm that needs several scalars therefore draws
`Nseed` bytes for each of them, and additionally separates them by `info`.
`Nseed` is larger than `Ns` ({{ciphersuites}}) so that the derived scalar is
statistically close to uniform rather than merely unpredictable; deriving
several scalars from one seed instead would cap their joint entropy at the
length of that seed, which the unlinkability argument of
{{security-considerations}} does not permit. See {{randomness}}.

## Key Generation {#keygen}

An Anchor holds a key pair `(skA, pkA)`. It is derived from a seed, which is
what allows the test vectors in {{test-vectors}} to fix a key. The procedure is
the key generation of {{Section 3.2 of OPRF}}. Note that, by design, knowledge
of both `seed` and `info` is required, so the secrecy of `skA` rests on the
secrecy of `seed`; `info` is public.

Input:

~~~
  opaque seed[Nseed]
  PublicInput info
~~~

Output:

~~~
  Scalar skA
  Element pkA
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
~~~

Errors: `DeriveError`

~~~
def DeriveKeyPair(seed, info):
  skA = DeriveScalar(seed, info)
  pkA = G.ScalarMultGen(skA)

  return (skA, pkA)
~~~

The derivation is the one {{Section 3.2 of OPRF}} performs inline: hash
`seed || I2OSP(len(info), 2) || info` together with a counter, rejecting zero
({{derive-scalar}}). It differs only in its domain separation tag, which comes
from the protocol context of this document rather than from an OPRF context
string, and in the length of the seed.

A fresh key pair is generated by deriving one from a random seed.

Input:

~~~
  None
~~~

Output:

~~~
  Scalar skA
  Element pkA
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
~~~

Errors: `DeriveError`

~~~
def GenerateKeyPair():
  seed = random(Nseed)

  return DeriveKeyPair(seed, "GenerateKeyPair")
~~~

The Anchor publishes `SerializeElement(pkA)` in its configuration; see
{{PROTOCOLS}}.

## Context Binding {#context-binding}

Each Endorsement is bound at issuance to two contexts, the issuance context and
the redemption context, and a redemption succeeds only if the Client and the
Moderator use the same values. Both are opaque byte strings of at most
`2^16 - 1` bytes, a bound that follows from the two-byte length prefixes used
below. An algorithm that receives a longer context MUST reject it before
constructing a transcript. The two contexts are bound by deliberately different
means, reflecting who is trusted to choose each.

> **Editorial note.** This document treats both contexts as opaque. Application
> profiles define their contents and encodings. A profile may fix `ctx_red` to
> a domain-separated value shared by its Clients and Moderators before any
> issuance. Doing so does not require a Client to contact a Moderator before
> contacting an Anchor.

The issuance context, written `ctx_iss`, restricts *when* an Endorsement may be
redeemed; it might for example name the epoch the Endorsement was issued in.
Both parties hold it. It is bound by deriving the second commitment base from
it:

~~~
def CreateContextBase(ctx_iss):
  if len(ctx_iss) > 2^16 - 1:
    raise VerifyError

  context_base_input =
    I2OSP(len(ctx_iss), 2) || ctx_iss ||
    "ContextBase"

  return G.HashToGroup(context_base_input)
~~~

The Anchor forms its commitment under this base, and the base is recomputed at
verification time. The Client and the Anchor MUST agree on the issuance context.
Disagreement causes issuance to fail: a Client that uses any other value fails
the commitment-opening check in `Finalize`. The binding is therefore enforced by
the construction rather than by an explicit check, and a Client cannot bind an
Endorsement to an issuance context of its own choosing.

The redemption context, written `ctx_red`, restricts *where* an Endorsement
may be redeemed: a redemption succeeds only under the value the Endorsement was
issued under. It might for example identify the Moderator the Client intends to
redeem at, in which case the Endorsement is redeemable at that Moderator and at
no other. It is chosen by the Client and is hidden from the Anchor. It is bound
by placing it, together with a fresh Client-chosen nullifier `nf` of `Nn = 32`
bytes, in the signed message:

~~~
def Message(nf, ctx_red):
  if len(nf) > 2^16 - 1 or len(ctx_red) > 2^16 - 1:
    raise VerifyError

  return I2OSP(len(nf), 2) || nf ||
         I2OSP(len(ctx_red), 2) || ctx_red
~~~

`ComputeChallenge` also encodes the length of the complete `Message` in two
bytes. It therefore rejects a message longer than `2^16 - 1` bytes. With
`Nn = 32`, the largest usable `ctx_red` is consequently 65499 bytes, even though
its own length field can represent up to `2^16 - 1` bytes.

A redemption under a different redemption context recomputes a different
message, for which the Client holds no valid signature. Two consequences
follow. A Client has to fix `ctx_red` before it runs `Challenge`, that is,
before the Endorsement exists; and an Endorsement cannot afterwards be re-bound
to another value, so a Client that needs to redeem under several redemption
contexts needs a separate Endorsement, and so a separate issuance, for each.
Anchors bound how many Endorsements they grant a given Client in order to keep
Endorsements scarce ({{ARCH}}), so that budget is consumed per redemption
context rather than per Client.

The nullifier `nf` MUST be a fresh string of `Nn` uniformly random bytes,
generated by the Client, and MUST NOT be reused across Endorsements. It is
revealed at redemption, where the Moderator uses it to enforce that each
Endorsement is redeemed at most once.

The values the two contexts take determine the anonymity set a Client redeems
in, and a deployment can destroy the unlinkability the construction provides
without breaking any of its cryptographic properties; see
{{security-considerations}}.

# Endorsement Issuance {#issuance}

Issuance produces a signature on the message `Message(nf, ctx_red)` relative to
the public input `ctx_iss`. It consists of four algorithms, run in the order

~~~
  Commit -> Challenge -> Respond -> Finalize
~~~

`Commit` and `Respond` are run by the Anchor; `Challenge` and `Finalize` are
run by the Client. Both parties input the issuance context `ctx_iss`; only the
Client inputs the redemption context `ctx_red`.

Each of the first three algorithms outputs one protocol message, and the next
algorithm takes that message as a single input. The messages are the
*commitment*, the pair `(A, C)`; the *challenge*, a single scalar; and the
*response*, the triple `(s, y, t)`. The types `Commitment` and `Response` denote
the first and the last of these. The wire format of each message is defined in
{{wire}}.

All four algorithms take the group `G` as a parameter, and all of them except
`Respond`, which computes no hash, take the protocol context `ctx_proto`
({{config}}). Parameters are listed with each algorithm and are omitted from
the argument lists in the pseudocode.

## Anchor Commitment {#commit}

The Anchor opens a session by committing to the values it will later reveal.

Input:

~~~
  Scalar skA
  PublicInput ctx_iss
~~~

Output:

~~~
  AnchorState state
  Commitment commitment
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
  Nseed
~~~

Errors: `VerifyError`, `DeriveError`

~~~
def Commit(skA, ctx_iss):
  Z = CreateContextBase(ctx_iss)

  rand = random(3 * Nseed)
  a = DeriveScalar(Seed(rand, 0), "a")
  t = DeriveScalar(Seed(rand, 1), "t")
  y = DeriveScalar(Seed(rand, 2), "y")

  A = G.ScalarMultGen(a)
  C = G.ScalarMultGen(t) + y * Z

  state = (a, y, t)
  commitment = (A, C)

  return state, commitment
~~~

The Anchor stores `state` for the duration of the session and sends `commitment`
to the Client in a `CommitMessage` ({{wire}}). Note that `skA` is not used in
`Commit`; it appears in the interface because an implementation MAY choose to
carry it in the session state rather than reload it in `Respond`.

`Commit` draws all of its randomness in one call and splits it into one seed
per scalar ({{derive-scalar}}). A test vector fixes the single value `rand`;
`y` is nonzero by construction.

## Client Challenge {#challenge}

The Client blinds the Anchor's commitment, derives the challenge over the
blinded values, and returns the challenge in blinded form.

Input:

~~~
  Element pkA
  PublicInput ctx_iss
  PrivateInput ctx_red
  Commitment commitment
~~~

Output:

~~~
  ClientState state
  Scalar challenge
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
  Nn
  Nseed
~~~

Errors: `VerifyError`, `DeriveError`

~~~
def Challenge(pkA, ctx_iss, ctx_red, commitment):
  (A, C) = commitment

  if len(ctx_iss) > 2^16 - 1 or len(ctx_red) > 2^16 - 1:
    raise VerifyError

  rand = random(Nn + 4 * Nseed)
  nf = rand[0 .. Nn]
  seeds = rand[Nn .. Nn + 4 * Nseed]

  r1     = DeriveScalar(Seed(seeds, 0), "r1")
  r2     = DeriveScalar(Seed(seeds, 1), "r2")
  gamma1 = DeriveScalar(Seed(seeds, 2), "gamma1")
  gamma2 = DeriveScalar(Seed(seeds, 3), "gamma2")

  m = Message(nf, ctx_red)
  if len(m) > 2^16 - 1:
    raise VerifyError
  gamma = gamma1 * G.ScalarInverse(gamma2)

  blinded_A = G.ScalarMultGen(r1) + gamma * A
  blinded_C = gamma1 * C + G.ScalarMultGen(r2)
  blinded_commitment = (blinded_A, blinded_C)

  c = ComputeChallenge(ctx_iss, blinded_commitment, m)
  if c == 0:
    raise VerifyError

  challenge = c * gamma2

  state = (nf, ctx_iss, ctx_red, commitment,
           r1, r2, gamma1, gamma2, challenge, c)

  return state, challenge
~~~

As in `Commit`, all randomness is drawn in one call and split: the first `Nn`
bytes are the nullifier, and the remaining `4 * Nseed` bytes are four seeds,
one per blinding scalar. `ComputeChallenge` is as follows.

~~~
def ComputeChallenge(ctx_iss, commitment, m):
  (A, C) = commitment

  if len(ctx_iss) > 2^16 - 1 or len(m) > 2^16 - 1:
    raise VerifyError

  Am = G.SerializeElement(A)
  Cm = G.SerializeElement(C)

  challenge_transcript =
    I2OSP(len(ctx_iss), 2) || ctx_iss ||
    I2OSP(len(Am), 2) || Am ||
    I2OSP(len(Cm), 2) || Cm ||
    I2OSP(len(m), 2) || m ||
    "Challenge"

  c = G.HashToScalar(challenge_transcript)

  return c
~~~

Two challenge values appear here: `c` is computed
over the *blinded* commitment and is the value that ends up in the Endorsement
({{finalize}}); it never leaves the Client. The `challenge` message the Anchor
receives is its blinded form `c * gamma2`, and the Anchor cannot recover `c`
from it because `gamma2` is uniform and secret.

`HashToScalar` can return zero, whereas the construction requires a nonzero
challenge. `Challenge` therefore aborts in that case rather than resampling, so
that the challenge remains a deterministic function of the transcript. The
abort occurs with probability approximately `1/p` and is not expected to be
observed in practice; see {{security-considerations}}.

The Client sends `challenge` to the Anchor in a `ChallengeMessage` ({{wire}})
and retains `state`.

## Anchor Response {#respond}

The Anchor answers the challenge and closes the session.

Input:

~~~
  Scalar skA
  AnchorState state
  Scalar challenge
~~~

Output:

~~~
  Response response
~~~

Errors: `VerifyError`, `SessionError`

~~~
def Respond(skA, state, challenge):
  (a, y, t) = state

  if challenge == 0:
    raise VerifyError

  s = a + challenge * y * skA
  response = (s, y, t)

  return response
~~~

Before reading session state, an Anchor MUST atomically claim and consume it.
Only the instance that wins that claim may call `Respond`; tombstones MUST be
retained through session expiry. Answering two distinct challenges on the same
state discloses the signing key: from
`s1 = a + c1 * y * skA` and `s2 = a + c2 * y * skA` with `c1 != c2`, and `y`
revealed in the response, an attacker recovers
`skA = (s1 - s2) * ScalarInverse((c1 - c2) * y)`. An Anchor that receives a
second `ChallengeMessage` for a session it has already answered MUST raise a
`SessionError` and MUST NOT compute a response.

## Client Finalization {#finalize}

The Client checks the Anchor's response and unblinds it into an Endorsement.

Input:

~~~
  Element pkA
  ClientState state
  Response response
~~~

Output:

~~~
  Endorsement endorsement
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
~~~

Errors: `VerifyError`

~~~
def Finalize(pkA, state, response):
  (nf, ctx_iss, ctx_red, commitment,
   r1, r2, gamma1, gamma2, challenge, c) = state
  (A, C) = commitment
  (s, y, t) = response

  Z = CreateContextBase(ctx_iss)

  if y == 0:
    raise VerifyError
  if C != G.ScalarMultGen(t) + y * Z:
    raise VerifyError
  if G.ScalarMultGen(s) != A + (challenge * y) * pkA:
    raise VerifyError

  gamma = gamma1 * G.ScalarInverse(gamma2)

  s_final = gamma * s + r1
  y_final = gamma1 * y
  t_final = gamma1 * t + r2

  return Endorsement(c, s_final, y_final, t_final, nf)
~~~

The three checks verify that the Anchor opened its commitment honestly and
answered the challenge under its published key. A Client whose `Finalize`
raises an error MUST discard the session state and MUST NOT retry the exchange
with the same state; it may start a fresh session.

An Endorsement consists of the signature `(c, s, y, t)` together with the
nullifier; its encoding is given in {{endorsement-encoding}}. The contexts it
is bound to are not part of it. They are inputs to verification, supplied by
the verifier, and a Client keeps its own copy of them for as long as it holds
the Endorsement.

The Endorsement is held privately by the Client until it is redeemed
({{redemption}}). The Anchor never sees it.

## Endorsement Verification {#verify}

An Endorsement is publicly verifiable under the issuing Anchor's public key.

The two contexts are inputs to `Verify` in addition to the Endorsement. A
verifier therefore states the pair it is willing to accept and learns whether
the Endorsement was issued under it.

Input:

~~~
  Element pkA
  Endorsement endorsement
  PublicInput ctx_iss
  PublicInput ctx_red
~~~

Output:

~~~
  boolean verified
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
  Nn
~~~

~~~
def Verify(pkA, endorsement, ctx_iss, ctx_red):
  (c, s, y, t, nf) = endorsement

  if (y == 0 or c == 0 or len(nf) != Nn or
      len(ctx_iss) > 2^16 - 1 or len(ctx_red) > 2^16 - 1):
    return false

  Z = CreateContextBase(ctx_iss)
  m = Message(nf, ctx_red)
  if len(m) > 2^16 - 1:
    return false

  C = G.ScalarMultGen(t) + y * Z
  A = G.ScalarMultGen(s) - (c * y) * pkA
  commitment = (A, C)

  return c == ComputeChallenge(ctx_iss, commitment, m)
~~~

`Verify` is stated here for completeness and for use in test vectors. A
Moderator does not call it directly: a redemption does not reveal which Anchor
issued the Endorsement, so the check is instead carried out under an
issuer-hiding proof ({{redemption}}). The Client MUST NOT reveal the Anchor's
public key to the Moderator.

An honestly produced Endorsement always verifies. Writing `gamma` for
`gamma1 * ScalarInverse(gamma2)`, and `A_anchor` and `C_anchor` for the two
elements of the Anchor's commitment, the commitment reconstructed by `Verify` is
exactly the blinded commitment the Client hashed in `Challenge`:

~~~
  C = t_final * B + y_final * Z
    = gamma1 * (t * B + y * Z) + r2 * B
    = gamma1 * C_anchor + r2 * B
    = blinded_C

  A = s_final * B - (c * y_final) * pkA
    = (gamma * s + r1) * B - (c * gamma1 * y) * pkA
    = r1 * B + gamma * A_anchor
    = blinded_A
~~~

where the last step uses `s = a + challenge * y * skA` and
`challenge = c * gamma2`, so that the two terms in `skA` cancel.

## Encodings {#wire}

This section gives the encoding of the three messages exchanged during
issuance, of the session identifier that correlates them, and of the
Endorsement they produce.

`Element` and `Scalar` are the fixed-length encodings produced by
`SerializeElement` and `SerializeScalar`, of `Ne` and `Ns` bytes respectively.
A recipient MUST deserialize every received `Element` and `Scalar`, and MUST
abort the session with a `DeserializeError` if deserialization fails. In
particular, deserializing an `Element` rejects the group identity element.

### Issuance Messages {#issuance-messages}

The three messages exchanged during issuance are carried in the
`EndorsementRequest` and `EndorsementResponse` bodies defined in {{PROTOCOLS}},
whose transport is HTTP.

Issuance has three messages, but the Anchor sends the first of them, and HTTP is
client-initiated. The Client therefore opens the session with a request whose
`body` is **empty**: it is a trigger, not a protocol message, and the three moves
of {{scheme}} are executed after it. The "Exchanges" field of the IHAT
registration in {{PROTOCOLS}} counts HTTP exchanges, of which there are still
two. Neither context appears on the wire ({{context-binding}}).

| Exchange | Request body | Response body |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | empty | `CommitMessage` |
| 2 | `ChallengeMessage` | `ResponseMessage` |
{: title="Mapping of the three issuance messages onto the two HTTP exchanges"}


The Anchor opens the session with its commitment, whose two elements are carried
as separate fields:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  opaque session_id<V>;
  Element A;
  Element C;
} CommitMessage;
~~~

The Client replies with the blinded challenge, echoing the session identifier:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  opaque session_id<V>;
  Scalar challenge;
} ChallengeMessage;
~~~

The Anchor replies with its response, which closes the session:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Scalar s;
  Scalar y;
  Scalar t;
} ResponseMessage;
~~~

### Session Identifier {#session-id}

The Anchor holds secret state between its two moves ({{sessions}}), so the two
exchanges have to be correlated. `session_id` does that. It is generated by
the Anchor, opaque to the Client, and echoed unmodified in `ChallengeMessage`.

An Anchor MUST NOT have two open sessions with the same `session_id`, and SHOULD
generate it with a cryptographically secure random number generator so that a
Client cannot guess, and so collide with, another Client's session. An Anchor
that receives a `ChallengeMessage` whose `session_id` does not correspond to one
of its open sessions MUST raise a `SessionError`.

The session identifier MUST NOT be bound into the challenge transcript, and it
MUST NOT be an input to any algorithm in {{issuance}}. It is a value the Anchor
chose and therefore recognises; anything the Anchor recognises that also reached
the Endorsement would let it link a redemption back to the issuance session.



### Endorsement {#endorsement-encoding}

The output of `Finalize` is encoded as follows.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Scalar c;
  Scalar s;
  Scalar y;
  Scalar t;
  opaque nf[Nn];
} Endorsement;
~~~

This structure is never sent to an Anchor. The Client holds it until it is
redeemed, and {{redemption}} defines what is sent to a Moderator then. The
issuance and redemption contexts are not carried in it: they are inputs to
`Verify` ({{verify}}) and to redemption, held by the verifier.

## Session Handling {#sessions}

An Anchor is stateful: it holds the secret state produced by `Commit` from the
moment it sends `CommitMessage` until it answers or discards the session. That
state is single-use; see {{respond}} and {{security-considerations}}.

An Anchor SHOULD bound both the number of concurrent open sessions per Client
and the lifetime of an open session, and SHOULD discard state for sessions that
are not completed within that lifetime. Discarding state early is always safe:
it causes the Client's `Finalize` to be unreachable, but cannot produce an
invalid Endorsement.

# Endorsement Redemption {#redemption}

A Client redeems an Endorsement at a Moderator. The message a Client sends is
carried in the `CredentialRequest` structure of {{PROTOCOLS}}
({{redemption-wire}}).

An Endorsement is intended for one accepted redemption in the replay scope
defined by {{PROTOCOLS}}, so redemption does not have to hide the signature: the
Client reveals it, and the Moderator deduplicates on the nullifier. What
redemption must hide is *which* Anchor issued it. The
signature of {{issuance}} verifies under one Anchor's public key, so presenting
it against that key would name the Anchor. Instead the Client rerandomizes the
key ({{rerandomization}}) and proves in zero knowledge that the rerandomized key
belongs to some Anchor in the Moderator's Anchor Set ({{issuer-proof}}).

Redemption is one message from the Client, answering a challenge from the
Moderator. The Moderator holds the ordered Anchor Set and carries it in that
challenge; the Client learns it there and locates its own Anchor in it. Both
parties input the two contexts.

~~~
   Client(endorsement,                   Moderator(anchor_set,
          ctx_iss, ctx_red)                        ctx_iss, ctx_red)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                    challenge (carries anchor_set)
                              <--------

   index = the position of the Client's Anchor in anchor_set
   redemption = RedeemRequest(anchor_set, index, endorsement,
                              ctx_iss, ctx_red, challenge_digest)

                             redemption
                              -------->

              nf = FinalizeRedeem(anchor_set, redemption,
                                  ctx_iss, ctx_red,
                                  challenge_digest)
~~~
{: #fig-redemption title="Endorsement redemption overview"}

`anchor_set` is the ordered list of Anchor public keys the Moderator accepts.
The Moderator carries it in the `Challenge` structure of {{PROTOCOLS}}. Both
parties MUST use the same list in the same order; otherwise proof verification
fails. {{redemption-wire}} defines the proof vector lengths for that list.

An Anchor Set is valid only if it contains between 2 and `2^16 - 1` keys,
inclusive; no key is the identity element; and no two keys are equal. The lower
bound preserves issuer hiding, and the upper bound ensures that its count fits
the two-byte field in the proof transcript. Duplicate keys do not enlarge the
anonymity set and make branch identity ambiguous, so they are rejected rather
than assigned special semantics. The Client and Moderator MUST validate these
conditions before any algorithm indexes or constructs a transcript from the
set:

~~~
def ValidAnchorSet(anchor_set):
  n = len(anchor_set)
  if n < 2 or n > 2^16 - 1:
    return false

  seen = {}
  for i in range(n):
    if anchor_set[i] == G.Identity():
      return false
    encoded = G.SerializeElement(anchor_set[i])
    if encoded in seen:
      return false
    seen.add(encoded)

  return true
~~~

Wire decoding already rejects non-canonical element encodings and identity
elements ({{wire}}). `ValidAnchorSet` additionally applies to locally configured
sets and rejects duplicate decoded keys.

`challenge_digest` binds the redemption to the challenge that triggered it. It
is computed from the Moderator's challenge as specified in {{PROTOCOLS}}, and
is exactly 32 bytes in MoLE. An algorithm MUST reject any other length before
constructing the proof transcript. Note that this challenge is the Moderator's,
and has nothing to do with the issuance challenge of {{challenge}}.

`index` is the position in `anchor_set` of the public key of the Anchor that
issued the Endorsement. A Client whose Anchor does not appear in `anchor_set`
cannot redeem at this Moderator and MUST NOT try: the Endorsement will not
verify under any key it can prove membership for.

## Key Rerandomization {#rerandomization}

The Client shifts the Anchor's public key by a secret scalar `delta` of its own
choosing and adapts the signature to the shifted key. Writing `pkA` for
`anchor_set[index]` and `(c, s, y, t, nf)` for the Endorsement:

~~~
  X_hat = pkA + delta * B
  s_hat = s + (c * y) * delta
~~~

The result is an Endorsement `(c, s_hat, y, t, nf)` that verifies under `X_hat`
exactly as the original verifies under `pkA`, because the shift cancels in the
reconstruction of `A`:

~~~
  s_hat * B - (c * y) * X_hat
    = (s + c * y * delta) * B - (c * y) * (pkA + delta * B)
    = s * B - (c * y) * pkA
~~~

Every other value `Verify` recomputes is untouched, so a Moderator can check
the signature by running `Verify` ({{verify}}) with `X_hat` in place of `pkA`.

This shift is *additive*, so issuance is left completely unmodified and the
unforgeability of {{issuance}} carries over
({{security-considerations}}); and it is *public*, in the sense that `X_hat` on
its own says nothing about which key it was derived from, since `delta * B` is
uniformly distributed over the group. Because any Client can produce a uniform
`X_hat`, it does not demonstrate that the key is a rerandomization of an
accepted Anchor key. The Client therefore also proves knowledge of `delta` for
one key in the Anchor Set without revealing which one.

## The Issuer-Hiding Proof {#issuer-proof}

The Client proves knowledge of `delta` such that
`X_hat - anchor_set[i] = delta * B` for at least one `i`, without revealing
`i`. This is a one-out-of-`n`
disjunction of Schnorr statements, all of them over the same base `B`.

Such a disjunction is classically composed with the technique of Cramer,
Damgard and Schoenmakers {{CDS94}}, in which the Client answers the branch it
can and simulates the others, sending one challenge and one response per
branch. That proof is linear in `n`, and the Anchor Set is also the anonymity
set ({{security-considerations}}). This document instead composes the branches
with the *stacking* technique of Goel, Green, Hall-Andersen and Kaptchuk
{{STACKSIG}}, whose proof is logarithmic in `n`: the Client sends a single
response, which every branch reuses, together with a commitment whose opening
forces one branch to have been answered honestly. {{FFKLLS26}} applies the same
two compositions, for the same purpose, to a pairing-based credential.

Both compositions are used with the same rerandomization ({{rerandomization}}),
and switching between them changes neither issuance nor {{verify}}.

Each branch is the discrete logarithm proof of {{SIGMA}}, and the composition
below could be expressed in that framework. It is written out here instead, so
that this document fixes the transcript and the encodings without depending on
work in progress.

> **TODO:** Revisit once {{SIGMA}} is stable.

Throughout this section and its subsections, `x / y` denotes integer division
of nonnegative integers, that is the quotient rounded down, and `x mod y` the
remainder.

### The Branch Proof {#branch}

The disjunction is proved over the statements

~~~
  Y[i] = X_hat - anchor_set[i]   for i in range(n)
~~~

of which the Client can answer branch `index`, where `Y[index] = delta * B`.

A single branch is proved by the usual three moves: the Client draws a nonce
`r` and commits `T = r * B`; the verifier sends a challenge `c`; the Client
answers `z = r - c * delta`; and the verifier checks that
`T = c * Y[index] + z * B`.

Read the other way around, this check determines the commitment from the
challenge and the response:

~~~
def BranchCommitment(proof_challenge, response, Y):
  return proof_challenge * Y + G.ScalarMultGen(response)
~~~

Two properties of this branch proof are what allow the composition below, and
{{STACKSIG}} calls a sigma protocol with both of them *stackable*. First, a
verifying commitment can be computed for *any* statement from a challenge and a
response, by the function above, without knowing a witness; this is the
extended honest-verifier zero-knowledge property. Second, the response of an
honest run is a uniformly distributed scalar whatever the statement and the
witness, so one response can be reused across branches without revealing which
branch produced it.

It follows that a verifier given `proof_challenge` and one `response` can
compute a commitment for every branch, and that every branch then verifies by
construction. Nothing is proved by the responses themselves. What has to be
enforced is that the Client fixed the commitment of one branch *before* the
challenge existed, and could not afterwards change it.

### Partially Binding Commitments {#pbvc}

A *partially binding vector commitment* {{STACKSIG}} commits to a vector of
values such that one position, chosen when the commitment key is generated and
hidden from the verifier, is binding, while every other position can afterwards
be opened to any value. The Client commits the branch commitment of `index` at
the binding position, and after the challenge is known it opens every other
position to the branch commitment that the shared response determines. The
proof of one Schnorr branch is therefore honest; which one is hidden by the
commitment key.

This document uses the commitment of Section 5.2 of {{STACKSIG}} over pairs,
composed into a binary tree as described in Section 5.3 of {{STACKSIG}}, so
that a commitment to `2^q` values costs one commitment key and one opening per
level.

Two group elements are fixed. `B` is the generator, which is the base of the
commitment randomness. `G0` is a second base with no known discrete logarithm
relation to `B`:

~~~
  G0 = G.HashToGroup("StackBase")
~~~

`G0` is a fixed parameter of the ciphersuite, since the domain separation tag of
`HashToGroup` carries `ctx_proto` ({{config}}). It is derived by hashing a
constant so that no party knows its discrete logarithm; see
{{security-considerations}}.

A node of the tree commits two values with a commitment key `ck`, which is a
single group element. The two values are committed under two derived bases:

~~~
def CreateNodeBases(ck):
  return (G0 + ck, G0 - ck)
~~~

The bases always sum to `G0 + G0`, so a Client that knew the discrete logarithm
of both would know that of `G0`. It can therefore arrange to know one of them,
and does so by choosing which:

~~~
def CreateCommitmentKey(trapdoor, equivocal):
  E = G.ScalarMultGen(trapdoor)

  if equivocal == 0:
    return E - G0
  else:
    return G0 - E
~~~

The base of position `equivocal` is then `trapdoor * B`, and the base of the
other position is not, so the other position is the binding one. Both cases
produce a `ck` that is uniformly distributed over the group, so `ck` reveals
nothing about which position is which. This is the interpolation of
Section 5.2 of {{STACKSIG}} for a pair, written with the two positions placed
at `+1` and `-1` and `G0` at `0`.

A node commits its two values as two Pedersen commitments, one under each base:

~~~
def CommitNode(ck, rand, v_left, v_right):
  (base_left, base_right) = CreateNodeBases(ck)
  (r_left, r_right) = rand

  return (G.ScalarMultGen(r_left) + v_left * base_left,
          G.ScalarMultGen(r_right) + v_right * base_right)
~~~

A node is committed with the equivocal value set to zero, and is later reopened
to a value `v` by shifting that position's randomness:

~~~
def EquivocateNode(rand, trapdoor, equivocal, v):
  (r_left, r_right) = rand

  if equivocal == 0:
    return (r_left - trapdoor * v, r_right)
  else:
    return (r_left, r_right - trapdoor * v)
~~~

The commitment is unchanged by this, because the base of the equivocal position
is `trapdoor * B`:

~~~
  (r - trapdoor * v) * B + v * (trapdoor * B) = r * B
~~~

which is what the node committed when the value was zero. The binding position
is not shifted, and cannot be: moving it would need the discrete logarithm of
its base.

The values a node commits are scalars, so the commitments of the level below,
and the branch commitments at the leaves, are compressed before they are
committed:

~~~
def CompressValue(level, buf):
  return G.HashToScalar(I2OSP(level, 1) ||
                        I2OSP(len(buf), 2) || buf ||
                        "StackNode")

def EncodeNode(node):
  (left, right) = node
  return G.SerializeElement(left) ||
         G.SerializeElement(right)
~~~

The level index is bound into the compression so that a value cannot be
reinterpreted at another level of the tree.

The soundness of the proof requires `CompressValue` to be collision resistant.
Two branch commitments that compressed to the same scalar would open the
binding leaf to a statement it was not committed to, and two nodes of a level
that collided would swap the subtrees below them, in neither case requiring any
discrete logarithm. `HashToScalar` provides this for the ciphersuites of
{{ciphersuites}}; see {{security-considerations}}.

The tree has `N = 2^q` leaves, where `q` is the least integer with `2^q >= n`.
Level 0 is the leaves; for `1 <= j <= q`, level `j` has `N / 2^j` nodes, and
node `k` of level `j` commits the values of nodes `2 * k` and `2 * k + 1` of
level `j - 1`. Level `q` is the root. Every node of level `j` uses the same
commitment key `commitment_keys[j - 1]` and the same randomness; this is what
makes the proof logarithmic rather than linear.

If `N > n`, the statements are padded by repeating the last one:

~~~
def Statements(anchor_set, X_hat):
  n = len(anchor_set)
  q = 0
  while 2^q < n:
    q = q + 1

  for i in range(n):
    Y[i] = X_hat - anchor_set[i]
  for i in range(n, 2^q):
    Y[i] = Y[n - 1]

  return (Y, q)
~~~

A padded leaf therefore holds the same value as leaf `n - 1`, which both parties
compute the same way, whether or not `n - 1` is the branch the Client answered.
Padding adds neither an Anchor to the Anchor Set nor information to the proof.

### Challenge Computation {#proof-challenge}

The Fiat-Shamir challenge covers the whole statement -- the Anchor Set, the
rerandomized key, the signature being presented, the two contexts, and the
Moderator's challenge digest -- together with the first move of the proof,
which is the commitment keys and the root of the tree.

~~~
def ComputeProofChallenge(anchor_set, X_hat, endorsement, ctx_iss,
                          ctx_red, challenge_digest,
                          commitment_keys, root):
  (c, s_hat, y, t, nf) = endorsement
  n = len(anchor_set)

  anchor_set_enc = ""
  for i in range(n):
    anchor_set_enc = anchor_set_enc ||
                     G.SerializeElement(anchor_set[i])

  ck_enc = ""
  for j in range(len(commitment_keys)):
    ck_enc = ck_enc || G.SerializeElement(commitment_keys[j])

  proof_transcript =
    I2OSP(n, 2) || anchor_set_enc ||
    G.SerializeElement(X_hat) ||
    G.SerializeScalar(c) || G.SerializeScalar(s_hat) ||
    G.SerializeScalar(y) || G.SerializeScalar(t) ||
    I2OSP(len(nf), 2) || nf ||
    I2OSP(len(ctx_iss), 2) || ctx_iss ||
    I2OSP(len(ctx_red), 2) || ctx_red ||
    I2OSP(len(challenge_digest), 2) || challenge_digest ||
    ck_enc || EncodeNode(root) ||
    "IssuerProof"

  return G.HashToScalar(proof_transcript)

`n` is prefixed and `Element` encodings are fixed-length, so `anchor_set_enc`
and `ck_enc` are unambiguous without length prefixes of their own; `q`, and with
it the number of commitment keys, is determined by `n`. The label
`"IssuerProof"` separates this transcript from the issuance transcript of
{{challenge}}, which is hashed with the same function.

Callers invoke `ComputeProofChallenge` only after validating the Anchor Set,
the context bounds, the 32-byte `challenge_digest`, the `Nn`-byte nullifier,
and the exact commitment-key count. These checks ensure that every count and
length represented in two bytes is in range before the transcript is built.

Unlike the issuance challenge, the issuer-proof challenge is allowed to be
zero. A zero challenge yields a proof that verifies, and no branch is privileged
by it.

~~~

The first move commits only the path from leaf `index` to the root: at each
level the Client commits the value it holds on one side and zero on the other,
having generated that level's commitment key so that the *other* side is the
equivocal one. The third move then computes the branch commitment of every
statement from the single response, equivocates each level to the value its
sibling subtree now has, and rebuilds the tree with the equivocated randomness.
The root is unchanged by this, which is why the verifier can recompute it.

**The Client MUST derive `r`, every `trapdoor`, and every node randomness
freshly for each redemption.** This requirement is load-bearing, not defensive.
`ProveIssuer` is a deterministic function of `rand`, so two redemptions that
reuse it share the nonce `r` while answering two different challenges, and from
`response1 = r - proof_challenge1 * delta` and
`response2 = r - proof_challenge2 * delta` anyone recovers

~~~
  delta = (response2 - response1) *
          ScalarInverse(proof_challenge1 - proof_challenge2)
~~~

and with it `X_hat - delta * B`, which is the public key of the Anchor that
issued the Endorsement. Reuse therefore does not merely weaken issuer hiding, it
destroys it, and it strips the rerandomization from the signature for everyone,
not only for the Moderator. A repeated commitment key is in any case a value a
verifier can recognize, and would link the two redemptions to each other.

Proving is linear in `n`: the second loop computes `N` branch commitments and
`N - 1` node commitments, however short the proof is. The saving is in
communication, not in computation; see {{security-considerations}}.

  return proof_challenge == ComputeProofChallenge(
      anchor_set, X_hat, endorsement, ctx_iss, ctx_red,
      challenge_digest, commitment_keys, root)
~~~

The verifier computes a commitment for every branch from the single response,
rebuilds the whole tree from those commitments and the openings it was given,
and checks that the root it arrives at is the one the challenge was computed
over. Neither the branch commitments nor the interior nodes are transmitted.

`VerifyIssuer` returns `false` rather than raising an error, so that it is a
total predicate on its inputs, as `Verify` ({{verify}}) is. Its vector-length
checks are defensive restatements of its input types: a redemption whose vectors
have any other length is rejected when it is deserialized
({{redemption-wire}}). The remaining checks validate the Moderator's own inputs,
including the Anchor Set ({{finalize-redeem}}).

A proof produced by `ProveIssuer` passes `VerifyIssuer`. For branch `index`,

~~~
  proof_challenge * Y[index] + response * B
    = proof_challenge * delta * B
      + (r - proof_challenge * delta) * B
    = r * B
~~~

which is the commitment the Client committed at the binding leaf, and every
other leaf holds by definition the commitment the verifier recomputes. Each
level then reproduces the node the Client committed: the binding side is
unchanged, and the equivocal side was shifted to match.

Conversely, the binding leaf is fixed before `proof_challenge` exists and
cannot be moved afterwards, so a Client that could produce an accepting proof
for two different challenges would yield `delta` for that leaf's statement. The
soundness of the proof rests on that, and on nothing about the other branches;
see {{security-considerations}}.

## Redemption Request {#redeem-request}

The Client produces a redemption from an Endorsement it holds.

Input:

~~~
  Element anchor_set[n]
  uint16 index
  Endorsement endorsement
  PublicInput ctx_iss
  PublicInput ctx_red
  opaque challenge_digest[32]
~~~

Output:

~~~
  Redemption redemption
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
  Nn
  Nseed
~~~

Errors: `VerifyError`, `DeriveError`

~~~
def RedeemRequest(anchor_set, index, endorsement, ctx_iss, ctx_red,
                  challenge_digest):
  (c, s, y, t, nf) = endorsement
  n = len(anchor_set)

  if (not ValidAnchorSet(anchor_set) or index < 0 or index >= n or
      len(ctx_iss) > 2^16 - 1 or len(ctx_red) > 2^16 - 1 or
      len(challenge_digest) != 32 or len(nf) != Nn or
      len(Message(nf, ctx_red)) > 2^16 - 1):
    raise VerifyError

  (Y, q) = Statements(anchor_set, G.Identity())
  nrand = (3 * q + 2) * Nseed

  rand = random(nrand)
  delta = DeriveScalar(Seed(rand, 0), "delta")

  X_hat = anchor_set[index] + delta * B
  s_hat = s + (c * y) * delta
  shown = Endorsement(c, s_hat, y, t, nf)

  proof_challenge, response, commitment_keys, openings =
    ProveIssuer(anchor_set, index, delta, X_hat, shown, ctx_iss,
                ctx_red, challenge_digest, rand[Nseed .. nrand])

  return Redemption(X_hat, shown, proof_challenge, response,
                    commitment_keys, openings)
~~~

A Client MUST NOT redeem against an invalid Anchor Set, and `RedeemRequest`
raises a `VerifyError` rather than producing a redemption. It checks `index`
before evaluating `anchor_set[index]`. Singleton rejection is the Client's own
protection, and is not redundant with the requirement on the Moderator not to
offer such a set ({{finalize-redeem}}): that requirement is of no help against a
Moderator that offers a single key precisely to learn which Anchor endorsed the
Client. Refusing also keeps the depth `q` of the tree at least one, so a
redemption always carries at least one commitment key.

The amount of randomness a redemption consumes depends on the size of the Anchor
Set, through the depth `q` of the tree ({{pbvc}}), and on nothing else; in
particular it does not depend on `index`. `Statements` is called here only to
obtain `q`, which is why the rerandomized key it is given is irrelevant.

`delta` MUST be freshly derived for every redemption, and MUST NOT be derived
from the Endorsement or from any other value a Client reuses. It is what makes
the redemption unlinkable to the Anchor, and reusing it across two redemptions
would link them to each other.

## Finalizing Redemption {#finalize-redeem}

The Moderator checks the signature under the rerandomized key and the proof
against its Anchor Set.

Input:

~~~
  Element anchor_set[n]
  Redemption redemption
  PublicInput ctx_iss
  PublicInput ctx_red
  opaque challenge_digest[32]
~~~

Output:

~~~
  opaque nf[Nn] or INVALID
~~~

Parameters:

~~~
  Group G
  PublicInput ctx_proto
  Nn
~~~

~~~
def FinalizeRedeem(anchor_set, redemption, ctx_iss, ctx_red,
                   challenge_digest):
  if redemption is malformed:
    return INVALID

  (X_hat, shown, proof_challenge, response,
   commitment_keys, openings) = redemption

  if (not ValidAnchorSet(anchor_set) or
      len(ctx_iss) > 2^16 - 1 or len(ctx_red) > 2^16 - 1 or
      len(challenge_digest) != 32):
    return INVALID
  if not Verify(X_hat, shown, ctx_iss, ctx_red):
    return INVALID
  if not VerifyIssuer(anchor_set, X_hat, shown, ctx_iss, ctx_red,
                      challenge_digest, proof_challenge, response,
                      commitment_keys, openings):
    return INVALID

  (c, s_hat, y, t, nf) = shown
  return nf
~~~

The first check is the endorsement verification of {{verify}}, run against the
rerandomized key. Together the two checks establish that the Client holds an
Endorsement issued under `ctx_iss` and `ctx_red` by one of the Anchors in
`anchor_set`, and reveal nothing further about which one. `FinalizeRedeem`
returns `INVALID` for every failure, including malformed encodings, malformed
vector lengths, invalid Anchor Sets, wrong context or digest lengths, and failed
cryptographic checks. On success it returns the nullifier `nf`.

`FinalizeRedeem` performs only cryptographic validation; it does not enforce
single use. After it returns `nf`, the Moderator MUST perform an atomic
check-and-record operation: reject if `nf` is already recorded; otherwise
record it as spent before granting anything on the strength of the redemption.
This replay check and state transition are a Moderator responsibility outside
the cryptographic API. A Moderator SHOULD scope its nullifier store to the
issuance context, since an Endorsement issued under a different `ctx_iss` does
not verify anyway. {{PROTOCOLS}} places these checks, and the check that
`ctx_iss` is current, at the Moderator.

A Moderator MUST NOT offer an Anchor Set of one key: with `n = 1` the tree has
depth zero, the proof carries no commitment key, and what remains is a plain
proof of knowledge of `delta` for the single key, which identifies the Anchor.
`FinalizeRedeem` rejects that case, but that rejection is a guard on the
Moderator's own configuration rather than a verdict on the redemption: a
Moderator that configures it has already lost the property before any proof is
checked. See {{security-considerations}}.

## Encodings {#redemption-wire}

A redemption is carried directly in the `endorsement_presentation` field of a
`CredentialRequest` defined by {{PROTOCOLS}}.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
  Element rerandomized_key;
  Endorsement shown_endorsement;
  Scalar proof_challenge;
  Scalar response;
  Element commitment_keys<V>;
  Scalar openings<V>;
} Redemption;
~~~

`shown_endorsement` uses the `Endorsement` structure of
{{endorsement-encoding}}, with `s` carrying `s_hat`. It is a valid Endorsement
under `rerandomized_key`, which is the point of {{rerandomization}}; it is not
the Endorsement the Client stored, and the Client MUST NOT send that one.

`commitment_keys` MUST hold exactly `q` elements and `openings` exactly
`2 * q` scalars, where `q` is the depth of the tree determined by the Anchor Set
the Moderator offered ({{pbvc}}). The two openings of level `j` are at positions
`2 * (j - 1)` and `2 * (j - 1) + 1`, in that order. A Moderator MUST reject any
other length as malformed rather than truncating or padding, and MUST NOT infer
the size of its own Anchor Set from the redemption. `FinalizeRedeem` reports
such malformed input as `INVALID`.

A redemption is therefore `Ne + 4 * Ns + Nn + 2 * Ns + q * Ne + 2 * q * Ns`
bytes plus the two vector length prefixes, which are two bytes each at the
sizes below. For `IHAT(P-256, SHA-256)` and an Anchor Set of ten keys, `q = 4`
and a redemption is 649 bytes, of which 456 are the proof; at 64 keys it is
843 bytes, of which 650 are the proof. The corresponding linear disjunction
{{CDS94}} would be 837 and 4293 bytes respectively. The stacked proof is the
smaller of the two for every Anchor Set of six or more keys, and its advantage
grows with the set, which is the reason for using it.

The Client MUST NOT reveal `pkA`, `index`, `delta`, or the Endorsement it
stored. Sending any of them defeats the point of redeeming under `X_hat`.

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A ciphersuite fixes the group, the hash functions, and the associated encodings
and domain separation tags. Both parties are assumed to agree on the
ciphersuite in use ({{config}}).

For each ciphersuite, `ctx_proto` is as computed in {{config}}. The nullifier
length is `Nn = 32` bytes and the seed length is `Nseed = Ns + 32` bytes, that
is 64 bytes, for both ciphersuites below. In the random-oracle model, the 256
bits in excess of `Ns` make the distribution induced by a fixed public hash
about `2^-128` from uniform ({{derive-scalar}}).

## IHAT(P-256, SHA-256)

`"ristretto255-SHA512"`.

The interface of {{group}} is instantiated as follows.

DeserializeScalar(buf):
: Deserialize a `Scalar` from a little-endian 32-byte string. Raise a
  `DeserializeError` if the result is not in `[0, Order()-1]`; note that this
  requires the top three bits of the input to be zero.

## Randomness {#randomness}

Every random value in this document is a seed of `Nseed` bytes, drawn with
`random` and consumed by `DeriveScalar` ({{derive-scalar}}); no scalar is
sampled directly. Implementations MUST draw seeds with a cryptographically
secure random number generator and MUST NOT reuse a seed across derivations.
They SHOULD treat a seed as being as sensitive as the values derived from it,
and SHOULD handle both in constant time: the seed drawn in `Commit` determines
the Anchor's session state, and the seed drawn in `Challenge` determines the
Client's blinding factors, so recovering either undoes the property that
algorithm provides.

> **Editorial note.** This document does not use the `RandomScalar()` member of
> {{OPRF}}'s group interface, and so does not have to resolve an inconsistency
> in it: {{Section 2.1 of OPRF}} defines `RandomScalar()` as "Chooses at random
> a nonzero element in GF(p)", while each of its ciphersuites defines it as "a
> uniformly random Scalar in the range `[0, G.Order() - 1]`", which includes
> zero. **TODO:** report the inconsistency against {{OPRF}}.

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

> **TODO.** This section is a summary of the properties the construction is

> statements and the corresponding reductions are not yet written.

The issuance protocol is the partially blind signature scheme of Tessaro and
Zhu {{TESSZHU}}, instantiated with the public input set to the issuance context.
Its security is analysed in the random oracle model, and one-more
unforgeability additionally in the algebraic group model under the discrete
logarithm assumption. Notably, its concurrent security does not rely on the
hardness of the ROS problem, which is broken in polynomial time, nor on the
mROS problem, which admits sub-exponential attacks.

Blindness:
: The Anchor's view of a session is the blinded challenge `c` alone. Because
  `gamma2` is uniform and nonzero, `c` is uniformly distributed and independent
  of the message and of the resulting signature in the ideal scheme, which is
  perfectly blind {{TESSZHU}}. The concrete seed-derived instantiation below is
  statistically blind rather than perfect.

Derived blinding factors:
: Blindness is unconditional only if the blinding factors are. `Challenge`
  derives them from seeds rather than sampling them, and `RedeemRequest` derives
  `delta` and the proof's nonces the same way, so the guarantee is
  statistical rather than perfect: an Endorsement and a session are linkable
  by an adversary that can find a seed consistent with both. Two properties of
  {{derive-scalar}} keep the loss negligible. Each scalar gets its own seed, so
  a seed consistent with any given value exists with overwhelming probability
  and finding one therefore separates nothing; and each seed is `Ns + 32` bytes,
  so each derived scalar is within about `2^-128` of uniform in the random-oracle
  model. Deriving several
  scalars from one seed, or from a seed of `Ns` bytes, would break this: the
  blinding factors of a session would then be jointly determined by fewer bits
  than they contain, an exhaustive search over seeds would identify the one
  session consistent with a given Endorsement, and unlinkability would hold
  only against a bounded adversary. Implementations MUST NOT do either.

One-more unforgeability:
: A Client that completes `k` issuance sessions under a given issuance context
  cannot produce `k+1` distinct valid Endorsements under that context,
  regardless of how many sessions it has completed under *other* issuance
  contexts {{TESSZHU}}. Thus, `k` completed grants yield at most `k` distinct
  valid Endorsements; this does not identify a corresponding issuance session.

Unforgeability under rerandomization:
: Rerandomization is additive and applies only after issuance, so issuance is
  the unmodified scheme of {{TESSZHU}} and its unforgeability is intended to
  carry over directly: a reduction relays the signing oracle verbatim, extracts
  `delta` and the branch it belongs to from the issuer-hiding proof, and undoes
  the public shift to obtain a forgery under the Anchor's own key. The
  extraction is the special soundness of the stacking composition
  (Section 7 of {{STACKSIG}}): two accepting proofs that share a first move but
  answer different challenges agree on the branch commitment at the binding
  position, and the branch proof of {{branch}} then yields `delta` for that
  branch's statement. Nothing in `RedeemRequest` gives a Client a signature it
  did not already hold: `X_hat` and `s_hat` are computed from values it has, and
  a Client that could produce an accepted redemption without an Endorsement
  from some Anchor in `anchor_set` would yield a forgery. **TODO:** this
  reduction is stated, not written out.

Issuer hiding:
: Redemption distributions are statistically indistinguishable no matter which
  Anchor in `anchor_set` issued the Endorsement, up to the loss quantified
  below. A Moderator, an Anchor, and the two colluding therefore learn only that
  some key in `anchor_set` was used from the cryptographic transcript. Three
  facts establish this property.
  `X_hat` is uniform over the choice of `delta`. The `response` of the single
  branch proof carries no dependence on the statement it was computed for
  ({{branch}}). And the commitment scheme of {{pbvc}} hides which position it
  binds: a commitment key is distributed over the group essentially
  independently of that position, and an opening essentially independently of
  whether the value it opens to was committed or equivocated. The proof
  therefore reveals the branch only through values that are almost independent
  of it, which is witness indistinguishability of the composition
  (Section 7 of {{STACKSIG}}).

: The commitment of {{pbvc}} would be *perfectly* hiding if its randomness were
  uniform, and is *statistically* hiding as specified here, because
  `DeriveScalar` never returns zero ({{derive-scalar}}). The two cases of
  `CreateCommitmentKey` therefore have slightly different supports -- `E - G0`
  is never `-G0` and `G0 - E` is never `G0` -- so a commitment key that happened
  to equal `G0` or `-G0` would reveal which position it binds, and the same
  exclusion applies to each opening and to `response`. Each of these `3 * q + 1`
  values excludes at most one point of a field of order `p`, so the total
  statistical distance is at most `(3 * q + 1) / p`, below `2^-250` for both
  ciphersuites of {{ciphersuites}}. Like blindness, issuer hiding therefore
  holds against unbounded computation up to a statistical loss, here from this
  exclusion as well as from the seed length of the derived randomness above.
  Note that it is the *binding* property of the commitment, and not its hiding,
  that is computational, which is the direction {{ARCH}} requires.

Partially binding commitments:
: The soundness of the issuer-hiding proof rests on two things: the commitment
  of {{pbvc}} binding one position of each node, and the collision resistance of
  the `CompressValue` of {{pbvc}}, without which a leaf or a node could be
  opened to a colliding value and no discrete logarithm would be extractable.
  The binding property is computational and
  reduces tightly to the discrete logarithm problem
  (Section 5.2 of {{STACKSIG}}): a Client that can open one position of a node
  two ways knows the discrete logarithm of that position's base, and a Client
  that can do so at both positions knows that of `G0`, since the two bases sum
  to `G0 + G0`. `G0` MUST therefore be the `HashToGroup` output specified in
  {{pbvc}} and MUST NOT be chosen, negotiated, or supplied by any party: a
  Client that knew its discrete logarithm could equivocate every position of
  every node, open the binding leaf to whatever the challenge required, and
  produce accepting redemptions holding no Endorsement at all. The same
  reduction is why a node commits its two values under two *separate* Pedersen
  commitments rather than one: with a single commitment over both bases, a
  Client could move the two positions in opposite directions and no discrete
  logarithm would be extractable.

Anchor Set size:
: Issuer hiding hides the Anchor *within the Anchor Set*, so the set is the
  anonymity set, and a redemption against a single-key set would name the
  Anchor outright ({{finalize-redeem}}); a Client MUST refuse such a set
  rather than rely on the Moderator to avoid offering one ({{redeem-request}}).
  Padding the set to a power of two ({{pbvc}}) does not enlarge it: a padded
  leaf repeats a statement rather than adding an Anchor, and the anonymity set
  is `n`, never `N`. More generally a Moderator that offers different Anchor
  Sets to different Clients partitions them, and one that reorders the set
  between Clients does the same; the set and its order MUST be the same for
  every Client offered a given `ctx_iss`. See {{ARCH}} for how set size
  interacts with Anchor diversity.

Proof size and cost:
: The proof is logarithmic in the size of the Anchor Set: two scalars, plus one
  element and two scalars for each of the `q` levels of the tree
  ({{redemption-wire}}). Computation is not. Both the prover and the verifier
  evaluate every branch and every node, which is `N` branch commitments and
  `N - 1` node commitments, so each performs a number of scalar multiplications
  linear in `N`. A large Anchor Set is therefore cheap in bandwidth and not in
  CPU, which reverses the tradeoff of the linear disjunction {{CDS94}} for
  bandwidth but not for work; {{FFKLLS26}} notes the same for its own
  instantiations. Two consequences for deployments: the linear disjunction is
  smaller for Anchor Sets of five keys or fewer, and because the tree is padded
  to a power of two, an Anchor Set of `2^q + 1` keys costs a whole extra level
  while adding one Anchor to the anonymity set.

Constant-time proving:
: `ProveIssuer` treats one leaf, and one side of each node on the path to it,
  differently from the others, and which leaf that is is exactly the secret the
  proof exists to hide. Implementations MUST NOT allow the binding path to be
  distinguished by timing, memory access patterns, or the amount of randomness
  consumed. The specification is written so that the last of these is not a
  signal: the randomness a redemption consumes is a function of `q` alone
  ({{redeem-request}}). The first move commits along the path only, and the third
  move visits every node of the tree; an implementation that instead recomputes
  the path lazily, or that branches on the value of `right` in a way an
  adversary can observe, reintroduces the signal.

Single-use sessions:
: **Implementations MUST ensure that the session state produced by `Commit` is
  never used more than once.** This requirement is load-bearing, not defensive.
  If an Anchor answers two distinct challenges `c1 != c2` on one `Commit` state,
  then from the two responses `s1 = a + c1*y*skA` and `s2 = a + c2*y*skA`, with
  `y` revealed in both, anyone recovers the signing key as
  `skA = (s1 - s2) * ScalarInverse((c1 - c2) * y)`. The requirement extends to
  process restarts, to replicas sharing a signing key, and to any retry or
  replay of a `ChallengeMessage`: an Anchor MUST atomically claim and close a
  session before reading its state or computing a response, and MUST answer a
  repeated `session_id` with a `SessionError` rather than recomputing. Anchors
  are stateful for this reason,
  and this state cannot be made stateless by sealing it into a cookie handed to
  the Client: sealing preserves the secrecy of `(a, y, t)` but not their
  single use, and single use is the property that matters here.

Challenge binding:
: `challenge_digest` enters the proof transcript ({{proof-challenge}}), so a
  proof produced for one challenge does not verify under any other. Whether that
  amounts to replay protection depends on the challenge being fresh, which this
  document does not control. {{PROTOCOLS}} and its transport profile define the
  challenge and its freshness. Irrespective of freshness, the Moderator's atomic
  nullifier check after {{finalize-redeem}} prevents an accepted redemption from
  being replayed in that store's scope. Challenge binding applies to the proof,
  not the signature: the
  signature is the same bytes whatever challenge is answered, which is why the
  nullifier check and not challenge binding is what makes an Endorsement
  single-use.

Context binding:
: The issuance context enters both the commitment base and the challenge
  transcript, and the redemption context enters the signed message, so an
  Endorsement does not verify under any other pair of contexts. Neither context
  is carried in the Endorsement; both are supplied by the verifier
  ({{verify}}), so a Client cannot assert the pair its Endorsement is checked
  against. A Client also cannot select the issuance context unilaterally: it is
  never sent from the Client to the Anchor, and using a value other than the one
  the Anchor committed under fails the opening check in `Finalize`.

Nullifier reuse:
: A Client that reuses a nullifier across Endorsements links those Endorsements
  to each other at redemption and, depending on the Moderator's nullifier
  store, causes all but the first redemption to be rejected. Nullifiers MUST be
  freshly generated.

Aborts on zero:
: `Challenge` aborts when the challenge hashes to zero and `Respond` aborts on
  a zero challenge. Both events occur with probability approximately `1/p` for
  honest parties, where `p` is the order of the group. A Client that observes
  such an abort learns nothing and SHOULD start a fresh session.

Context granularity:
: The unlinkability arguments above are cryptographic; the anonymity set they
  operate over is set by the contexts. Both contexts are visible at redemption,
  the issuance context directly and the redemption context through the fact
  that the Endorsement verifies under it, so each partitions Clients into the
  set that shares its value. Whatever {{ARCH}} eventually specifies them to be
  ({{context-binding}}), both values must therefore be **coarse**. Every Client
  holding an Endorsement issued under a given issuance context MUST derive the
  byte-identical `ctx_iss`, and every Client redeeming under a given
  redemption context MUST derive the byte-identical `ctx_red`. A deployment
  that refines either value, for instance by using a per-request timestamp
  rather than a shared epoch, or a per-Client identifier rather than a value
  shared by every Client redeeming in the same place, reduces the anonymity set
  accordingly, in the limit to a single Client, and does so without violating
  any cryptographic property of the construction. Implementations MUST NOT do
  so.

Session identifiers:
: The `session_id` of {{session-id}} is chosen by the Anchor and so is a value
  the Anchor recognises. It is confined to the transport: it is not an input to
  any algorithm of {{issuance}} and MUST NOT enter the challenge transcript. Were
  it bound into the Endorsement, the Anchor could recognise its own identifier at
  redemption and link the redemption to the issuance session.

Anonymity sets:
: The effective privacy a Client obtains also depends on deployment properties
  beyond this document, in particular the number of Clients an Anchor serves per
  epoch and the size of a Moderator's Anchor Set; see {{ARCH}}.
